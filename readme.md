## ‚≠ê NEW!

What is your MSFS Animal? Let's found out in the new 'Stats & Stuff' tab. (yes I *know* this is kinda dumb but I enjoyed it)

## üîß Configuration Detection

Automatically detects MSFS installations from:
- Microsoft Store/Xbox Game Pass (UWP)
- Steam installations
- Custom locations in UserCfg.opt files


## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **"Not Found" for Base Game**: May indicate UWP installation in protected location
- **"Disabled" Rolling Cache**: Configuration not found or explicitly disabled
- **Missing Configurations**: Check if MSFS is properly installed
- **Debug Information**: Enable debug logging via logo click in Help & About tab

## ü§ù Support & Feedback

This is an initial release that I use myself. While there's no formal support, I'm interested in feedback and bug reports.
